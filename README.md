 # Technical-Case-Studies-Hardware-Diagnostics-System-Recovery
This repository contains a collection of real-world technical case studies based on personal hands-on experience in hardware diagnostics, system troubleshooting, and recovery. Each case documents the problem context, investigative process, decision-making rationale, and final resolution, with an emphasis on systematic analysis rather than outcomes alone. The cases presented here were conducted independently, under real constraints, and are intended to demonstrate logical thinking, risk awareness, and practical problem-solving approaches in complex system failure scenarios.
